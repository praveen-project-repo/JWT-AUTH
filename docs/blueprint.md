# **App Name**: AuthRenew

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Securely authenticate users with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- JWT Generation: Generate JWTs upon successful login, including expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- Token Refresh: Implement a token refresh endpoint to automatically renew JWTs before they expire.
- Token Storage: Store JWTs securely in the browser's local storage.
- Route Protection: Protect routes in the React application by verifying the JWT before allowing access.
- Automatic Logout: Automatically log users out when their token expires or when the refresh token fails.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to convey security and trust.
- Background color: Very light indigo (#E8EAF6) for a clean, calming interface.
- Accent color: Blue-violet (#7986CB) as a contrast color to buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a neutral look.
- Use simple, clear icons for authentication actions (login, logout, refresh).
- Center-aligned layout for authentication forms to focus user attention.
- Subtle fade-in animations for alerts or confirmations upon successful/failed authentication.
